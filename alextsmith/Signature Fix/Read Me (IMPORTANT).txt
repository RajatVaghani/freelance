UPDATE : 

Please watch "Alignment Problem!" I've marked all the small error's. Please fix them :) 

IMPORTANT: 

I'm not experienced in HTML & CSS, but I've edited the files a bit! Please work with the files "Signature (Standard)" & "Signature (Reply)" Just fix the alignment problems i've marked in image. that's it. Please do not use other files for edit, or do not change anything expect aligning :) 

I hope you got this!

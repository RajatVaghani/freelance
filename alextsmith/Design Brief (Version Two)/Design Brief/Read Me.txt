2) Instead of alex email signature, raname the folder and files to only "Email Signature"

3) Everything must be "Pixel Perfect" like out PSD file. Font size, Icon Size, Colors must be same as out PSD file. 

4) I think the icons look too little, Can you increase the icons size ? and also remember, You've to sent me two files, one is standard, and one is reply version. You've to design both. 


This will be updated If Our manager needs any changes!
